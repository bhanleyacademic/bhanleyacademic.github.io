# Understanding Financial Aid at IU
Financial aid at IU is designed to help students cover the costs of tuition, fees, room and board, books, and other educational expenses. The aid can come in various forms, including grants, scholarships, loans, and work-study opportunities.
# Your Cost of Attendance
Before applying for financial aid, it's essential to understand your Cost of Attendance (COA). The COA includes tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and personal expenses. IU provides an estimated COA for different student categories, which can be found on their [financial aid website](https://financialaid.iu.edu/).

# Did I get double charged for tuition and fees?
No, you did not get double charged. Tuition and Student Services Fees are two separate components of your overall cost of attendance. Tuition covers the cost of your education, while Student Services Fees fund various student services and activities on campus. The fees change based on your enrollment status (full-time or part-time) and the number of credit hours you are taking.

When you change how many credit hours you are taking, your tuition and fees will adjust accordingly. For example, if you drop from 12 credit hours to 9 credit hours, your tuition will decrease because you are taking fewer classes. However, some fees may remain the same regardless of your credit hours, while others may change based on your enrollment status.
