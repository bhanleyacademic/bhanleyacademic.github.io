		I’m a Data Science student with a unique blend of academic and professional experiences. Originally from California, I made the move to Indiana to pursue my passion for data-driven problem solving and the intersection of technology, culture, and psychology.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before diving into data science, I earned associate degrees in computer science, anthropology, and psychology, which allowed me a multidisciplinary perspective on how technology and human behavior intersect. My academic journey has been anything but traditional, but it’s given me a broader understanding of how to approach problems creatively and holistically.

		I’m particularly fascinated by how data can reveal hidden patterns in everyday life, from understanding food cultures through ethnographic research to developing innovative software solutions such as my personal project that emulates a live TV experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I’m not coding or conducting data analysis, I enjoy exploring how food connects people. I also love sharing my knowledge with others, whether it’s tutoring in computer science or brainstorming ways to bring big ideas to life.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’m excited to continue growing in the field of data science and collaborating on projects that have real-world impact.
